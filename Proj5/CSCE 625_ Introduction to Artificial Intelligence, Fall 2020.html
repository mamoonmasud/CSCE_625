          <h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Pacman spends his life running from ghosts, but things were
 not always so. Legend has it that many years ago, Pacman's great
grandfather Grandpac learned to hunt ghosts for sport. However, he was
blinded by his power and could only track ghosts by their banging and
clanging.</p>
          <p>In this project, you will design Pacman agents that use
sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts. You'll advance from locating
 single, stationary ghosts to hunting packs of multiple moving ghosts
with ruthless efficiency.</p>
          <p>The code for this project contains the following files, available as a <a href="https://people.engr.tamu.edu/guni/csce625/5ghostbusters.zip">zip archive</a>.</p>

          <h2><a name="Welcome"></a>Ghostbusters and BNs</h2>
          <p>In the CSCE 625 version of Ghostbusters, the goal is to hunt
down scared but invisible ghosts. Pacman, ever resourceful, is equipped
with sonar (ears) that provides noisy readings of the Manhattan distance
 to each ghost. The game ends when Pacman has eaten all the ghosts. To
start, try playing a game yourself using the keyboard.</p>
          <pre>python3 busters.py</pre>
          <p>The blocks of color indicate where the each ghost could
possibly be, given the noisy distance readings provided to Pacman. The
noisy distances at the bottom of the display are always non-negative,
and always within 7 of the true distance. The probability of a distance
reading decreases exponentially with its difference from the true
distance.</p>
          <p>Your primary task in this project is to implement inference
 to track the ghosts. For the keyboard based game above, a crude form of
 inference was implemented for you by default: all squares in which a
ghost could possibly be are shaded by the color of the ghost. Naturally,
 we want a better estimate of the ghost's position. Fortunately, Bayes'
Nets provide us with powerful tools for making the most of the
information we have. Throughout the rest of this project, you will
implement algorithms for performing both exact and approximate inference
 using Bayes' Nets. The project is challenging, so we do encouarge you
to start early and seek help when necessary.</p>
          <p>While watching and debugging your code with the autograder,
 it will be helpful to have some understanding of what the autograder is
 doing. There are 2 types of tests in this project, as differentiated by
 their <code>*.test</code> files found in the subdirectories of the <code>test_cases</code> folder. For tests of class <code>DoubleInferenceAgentTest</code>,
 your will see visualizations of the inference distributions generated
by your code, but all Pacman actions will be preselected according to
the actions of the staff implementation. This is necessary in order to
allow comparision of your distributions with the staff's distributions.
The second type of test is <code>GameScoreTest</code>, in which your <code>BustersAgent</code> will actually select actions for Pacman and you will watch your Pacman play and win games.</p>
          <p>As you implement and debug your code, you may find it
useful to run a single test at a time. In order to do this you will need
 to use the -t flag with the autograder. For example if you only want to
 run the first test of question 1, use:</p>
          <pre>python3 autograder.py -t test_cases/q1/1-ObsProb</pre>
          <p>In general, all test cases can be found inside test_cases/q*.</p>
          <p>For this project, it is possible sometimes for the
autograder to time out if running the tests with graphics. To accurately
 determine whether or not your code is efficient enough, you should run
the tests with the <code>--no-graphics</code> flag. If the autograder
passes with this flag, then you will receive full points, even if the
autograder times out with graphics.</p>

          <h2><a name="Q0"></a>Question 0 (0 points): <code>DiscreteDistribution</code> Class</h2>
          <p>Throughout this project, we will be using the <code>DiscreteDistribution</code> class defined in <code>inference.py</code>
 to model belief distributions and weight distributions. This class is
an extension of the built-in Python dictionary class, where the keys are
 the different discrete elements of our distribution, and the
corresponding values are proportional to the belief or weight that the
distribution assigns that element. This question asks you to fill in the
 missing parts of this class, which will be crucial for later questions
(even though this question itself is worth no points).</p>
          <p>First, fill in the <code>normalize</code> method, which
normalizes the values in the distribution to sum to one, but keeps the
proportions of the values the same. Use the <code>total</code> method to
 find the sum of the values in the distribution. For an empty
distribution or a distribution where all of the values are zero, do
nothing. Note that this method modifies the distribution directly,
rather than returning a new distribution.</p>
          <p>Second, fill in the <code>sample</code> method, which draws
 a sample from the distribution, where the probability that a key is
sampled is proportional to its corresponding value. Assume that the
distribution is not empty, and not all of the values are zero. Note that
 the distribution does not necessarily have to be normalized prior to
calling this method (though it should). You may find Python's built-in <code>random.random()</code> function useful for this question.</p>
          <p>There are no autograder tests for this question, but the
correctness of your implementation can be easily checked. We have
provided <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/doctest.html" target="[object Object]">Python doctests</a> as a starting point, and you can feel free to add more and implement other tests of your own. You can run the doctests using:</p>
          <pre>python3 -m doctest -v inference.py</pre>
          <p>Note that, depending on the implementation details of the <code>sample</code> method, some correct implementations may not pass the doctests that are provided. To thoroughly check the correctness of your <code>sample</code>
 method, you should instead draw many samples and see if the frequency
of each key converges to be proportional of its corresponding value.</p>

          <h2><a name="Q1"></a>Question 1 (2 points): Observation Probability</h2>
          <p>In this question, you will implement the <code>getObservationProb</code> method in the <code>InferenceModule</code> base class in <code>inference.py</code>.
 This method takes in an observation (which is a noisy reading of the
distance to the ghost), Pacman's position, the ghost's position, and the
 position of the ghost's jail, and returns the probability of the noisy
distance reading given Pacman's position and the ghost's position. In
other words, we want to return <code>P(noisyDistance | pacmanPosition, ghostPosition)</code>.</p>
          <p>The distance sensor has a probability distribution over
distance readings given the true distance from Pacman to the ghost. This
 distribution is modeled by the function <code>busters.getObservationProbability(noisyDistance, trueDistance)</code>, which returns <code>P(noisyDistance | trueDistance)</code> and is provided for you. You should use this function to help you solve the problem, and use the provided <code>manhattanDistance</code> function to find the distance between Pacman's location and the ghost's location. Assume that <code>P(noisyDistance)</code> and <code>P(trueDistance)</code> are uniformly distributed</p>
          <p>However, there is the special case of jail that we have to
handle as well. Specifically, when we capture a ghost and send it to the
 jail location, our distance sensor deterministically returns <code>None</code>, and nothing else. So, if the ghost's position is the jail position, then the observation is <code>None</code> with probability 1, and everything else with probability 0. Conversely, if the distance reading is not <code>None</code>,
 then the ghost is in jail with probability 0. Make sure you
handle this special case in your implementation.</p>
          <p>To test your code and run the autograder for this question:</p>
          <pre>python3 autograder.py -q q1</pre>
          <p>As a general note, it is possible for some of the
autograder tests to take a long time to run for this project, and you
will have to exercise patience. As long as the autograder doesn't time
out, you should be fine (provided that you actually pass the tests).</p>

          <h2><a name="Q2"></a>Question 2 (3 points): Exact Inference Observation</h2>

          <p>In this question, you will implement the <code>observeUpdate</code> method in <code>ExactInference</code> class of <code>inference.py</code>
 to correctly update the agent's belief distribution over ghost
positions given an observation from Pacman's sensors. You are
implementing the online belief update for observing new evidence. The
observe method should, for this problem, update the belief at every
position on the map after receiving a sensor reading. You should iterate
 your updates over the variable self.allPositions which includes all
legal positions plus the special jail position. Beliefs represent the
probability that the ghost is at a particular location, and are stored
as a <code>DiscreteDistribution</code> object in a field called <code>self.beliefs</code>, which you should update.</p>

          <p>Before typing any code, write down the equation of the inference problem you are trying to solve. You should use the function <code>self.getObservationProb</code>
 that you wrote in the last question, which returns the probability of
an observation given Pacman's position, a potential ghost position, and
the jail position. You can obtain Pacman's position using <code>gameState.getPacmanPosition()</code>, and the jail position using <code>self.getJailPosition()</code>. Make sure that the belief distribution sums to 1.0. Your <code>normalize()</code> implementation might come in handy.</p>

          <p>In the Pacman display, high posterior beliefs are
represented by bright colors, while low beliefs are represented by dim
colors. You should start with a large cloud of belief that shrinks over
time as more evidence accumulates. As you watch the test cases, be sure
that you understand how the squares converge to their final coloring. </p>

          <p><em>Note:</em> your busters agents have a separate
inference module for each ghost they are tracking. That's why if you
print an observation inside the <code>update</code> function, you'll only see a single number even though there may be multiple ghosts on the board.</p>

          <p>To run the autograder for this question and visualize the output:</p>

          <pre>python3 autograder.py -q q2</pre>

          <p>If you want to run this test (or any of the other tests) without graphics you can add the following flag:</p>

          <pre>python3 autograder.py -q q2 --no-graphics</pre>

          <p><strong>*IMPORTANT*</strong>: In general, it is possible

graphics. To accurately determine whether or not your code is efficient
enough, you should run the tests with the <code>--no-graphics</code>

          <h2><a name="Q3"></a>Question 3 (3 points): Exact Inference with Time Elapse</h2>

          <p>In the previous question you implemented belief updates for
 Pacman based on his observations. Fortunately, Pacman's observations
are not his only source of knowledge about where a ghost may be. Pacman
also has knowledge about the ways that a ghost may move; namely that the
 ghost can not move through a wall or more than one space in one time
step.</p>

          <p>To understand why this is useful to Pacman, consider the
following scenario in which there is Pacman and one Ghost. Pacman
receives many observations which indicate the ghost is very near, but
then one which indicates the ghost is very far. The reading indicating
the ghost is very far is likely to be the result of a buggy sensor.
Pacman's prior knowledge of how the ghost may move will decrease the
impact of this reading since Pacman knows the ghost could not move so
far in only one move.</p>

          <p>In this question, you will implement the <code>elapseTime</code> method in <code>ExactInference</code>. The <code>elapseTime</code>
 step should, for this problem, update the belief at every position on
the map after one time step elapsing. Your agent has access to the
action distribution for the ghost through <code>self.getPositionDistribution</code>. In order to obtain the distribution over new positions for the ghost, given its previous position, use this line of code:</p>

          <pre>newPosDist = self.getPositionDistribution(gameState, oldPos)</pre>

          <p>Where <code>oldPos</code> refers to the previous ghost position. <code>newPosDist</code> is a <code>DiscreteDistribution</code> object, where for each position <code>p</code> in <code>self.allPositions</code>, <code>newPosDist[p]</code> is the probability that the ghost is at position <code>p</code> at time <code>t + 1</code>, given that the ghost is at position <code>oldPos</code> at time <code>t</code>.
 Note that this call can be fairly expensive, so if your code is timing
out, one thing to think about is whether or not you can reduce the
number of calls to <code>self.getPositionDistribution</code>.</p>

          <p>Before typing any code, write down the equation of the
inference problem you are trying to solve. In order to test your predict
 implementation separately from your update implementation in the
previous question, this question will not make use of your update
implementation.</p>

          <p>Since Pacman is not observing the ghost, this means the
ghost's actions will not impact Pacman's beliefs. Over time, Pacman's
beliefs will come to reflect places on the board where he believes
ghosts are most likely to be given the geometry of the board and what
Pacman already knows about their valid movements.</p>

          <p>For the tests in this question we will sometimes use a ghost with random movements and other times we will use the <code>GoSouthGhost</code>.
 This ghost tends to move south so over time, and without any
observations, Pacman's belief distribution should begin to focus around
the bottom of the board. To see which ghost is used for each test case
you can look in the .test files.</p>

<p>Note that Pacman has exact knowledge of the ghost position once it is caught. You can excess this knowledge through <code>gameState.getLivingGhosts()</code>. A dead ghost is in jail with probability 1.0 while a live ghost is in jail with probability 0.0.</p>

          <p>To run the autograder for this question and visualize the output:</p>

          <pre>python3 autograder.py -q q3</pre>

          <p>If you want to run this test (or any of the other tests) without graphics you can add the following flag:</p>

          <pre>python3 autograder.py -q q3 --no-graphics</pre>

          <p><strong>*IMPORTANT*</strong>: In general, it is possible
sometimes for the autograder to time out if running the tests with
graphics. To accurately determine whether or not your code is efficient
enough, you should run the tests with the <code>--no-graphics</code>
flag. If the autograder passes with this flag, then you will receive
full points, even if the autograder times out with graphics.</p>

          <p>As you watch the autograder output, remember that lighter
squares indicate that pacman believes a ghost is more likely to occupy
that location, and darker squares indicate a ghost is less likely to
occupy that location. For which of the test cases do you notice
differences emerging in the shading of the squares? Can you explain why
some squares get lighter and some squares get darker?</p>

          <p>Now that Pacman knows how to use both his prior knowledge
and his observations when figuring out where a ghost is, he is ready to
hunt down ghosts on his own. This question will use your <code>observeUpdate</code> and <code>elapseTime</code>
 implementations together, along with a simple greedy hunting strategy
which you will implement for this question. In the simple greedy
strategy, Pacman assumes that each ghost is in its most likely position
according to his beliefs, then moves toward the closest ghost. Up to
this point, Pacman has moved by randomly selecting a valid action.</p>

          <p>Implement the <code>chooseAction</code> method in <code>GreedyBustersAgent</code> in <code>bustersAgents.py</code>.
 Your agent should first find the most likely position of each remaining
 uncaptured ghost, then choose an action that minimizes the maze
distance to the closest ghost.</p>

          <p>To find the maze distance between any two positions <code>pos1</code> and <code>pos2</code>, use <code>self.distancer.getDistance(pos1, pos2)</code>. To find the successor position of a position after an action:</p>

          <pre>successorPosition = Actions.getSuccessor(position, action)</pre>

          <p>You are provided with <code>livingGhostPositionDistributions</code>, a list of <code>DiscreteDistribution</code> objects representing the position belief distributions for each of the ghosts that are still uncaptured.</p>

          <p>If correctly implemented, your agent should win the game in <code>q4/3-gameScoreTest</code>
 with a score greater than 700 at least 8 out of 10 times. Note: the
autograder will also check the correctness of your inference directly,
but the outcome of games is a reasonable sanity check.</p>

filtering algorithm for tracking a single ghost.</p>

          <p>First, implement the functions <code>initializeUniformly</code> and <code>getBeliefDistribution</code> in the <code>ParticleFilter</code> class in <code>inference.py</code>.
 A particle (sample) is a ghost position in this inference problem. Note
 that, for initialization, particles should be evenly (not randomly)
distributed across legal positions in order to ensure a uniform prior. You can get all legal ghost positions through <code>self.legalPositions</code>.</p>

          <p><strong>Note that the variable you store your particles in must be a list.</strong>
 A list is simply a collection of unweighted variables (positions in
this case). Storing your particles as any other data type, such as a
dictionary, is incorrect and will produce errors. The <code>getBeliefDistribution</code> method then takes the list of particles and converts it into a <code>DiscreteDistribution</code> object.</p>

 chooses actions that avoid other ghosts. Since the ghosts' transition

the noisy distances to each ghost. This structure can be extended to
more ghosts, but only two (a and b) are shown below.</p>

multiple ghosts simultaneously. Each particle will represent a tuple of
ghost positions that is a sample of where all the ghosts are at the

          <p>You can still obtain Pacman's position using <code>gameState.getPacmanPosition()</code>, but to get the jail position for a ghost, use <code>self.getJailPosition(i)</code>, since now there are multiple ghosts each with their own jail positions.</p>

          <p><strong>Your implementation should also again handle the special case when all particles receive zero weight.</strong> In this case, <code>self.particles</code> should be recreated from the prior distribution by calling <code>initializeUniformly</code>. As before, when Pacman captures a ghost then all affiliated particles should point to the jail position.</p>

          <p>As in the update method for the <code>ParticleFilter</code> class, you should again use the function <code>self.getObservationProb</code>
 to find the probability of an observation given Pacman's position, a
potential ghost position, and the jail position. The sample method of
the <code>DiscreteDistribution</code> class will also be useful.</p>

          <p>To run the autograder for this question and visualize the output:</p>

          <pre>python3 autograder.py -q q9</pre>

          <p>If you want to run this test (or any of the other tests) without graphics you can add the following flag:</p>

          <pre>python3 autograder.py -q q9 --no-graphics</pre>

          <p><strong>*IMPORTANT*</strong>: In general, it is possible
sometimes for the autograder to time out if running the tests with
graphics. To accurately determine whether or not your code is efficient
enough, you should run the tests with the <code>--no-graphics</code>
flag. If the autograder passes with this flag, then you will receive
full points, even if the autograder times out with graphics.</p>

          <h2><a name="Q10"></a>Question 10 (3 points): Joint Particle Filter Time Elapse and Full Test</h2>

          <p>Complete the <code>elapseTime</code> method in <code>JointParticleFilter</code> in <code>inference.py</code>
 to resample each particle correctly for the Bayes net. In particular,
each ghost should draw a new position conditioned on the positions of
all the ghosts at the previous time step.</p>

          <p>As in the last question, you can loop over the ghosts using:</p>

<pre>for i in range(self.numGhosts):
    ...</pre>

          <p>Then, assuming that <code>i</code> refers to the index of the ghost, to obtain the distributions over new positions for that single ghost, given the list (<code>prevGhostPositions</code>) of previous positions of all of the ghosts, use:</p>

          <pre>newPosDist = self.getPositionDistribution(gameState, prevGhostPositions, i, self.ghostAgents[i])</pre>

          <p>Note that completing this question involves grading both
question 9 and question 10. Since these questions involve joint
distributions, they require more computational power (and time) to
grade, so please be patient!</p>

          <p>As you run the autograder note that <code>q10/1-JointParticlePredict</code> and <code>q10/2-JointParticlePredict</code> test your <code>predict</code> implementations only, and <code>q10/3-JointParticleFull</code> tests both your <code>predict</code> and <code>update</code>
 implementations. Notice the difference between test 1 and test 3. In
both tests, pacman knows that the ghosts will move to the sides of the
gameboard. What is different between the tests, and why?</p>
