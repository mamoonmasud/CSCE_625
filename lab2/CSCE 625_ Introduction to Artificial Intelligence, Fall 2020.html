            during the assignment. You should submit these file with your code

           You may add new files (needed for the CBS implementation).</p>
          <p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Your code will be autograded for technical correctness. Please <em>do not</em>
 change the names of any provided functions or classes within the code,
or you will wreak havoc on the autograder. However, the correctness of
your implementation -- not the autograder's judgements -- will be the
final judge of your score. If necessary, we will review and grade
assignments individually to ensure that you receive due credit for your
work.</p>
          <p><strong>Academic Dishonesty:</strong> We will be checking
your code against other submissions in the class for logical redundancy.
 If you copy someone else's code and submit it with minor changes, we
will know. These cheat detectors are quite hard to fool, so please don't
 try. We trust you all to submit your own work only; <em>please</em> don't let us down. If you do, we will pursue the strongest consequences available to us.</p>
          <p><strong>Getting Help:</strong> You are not alone! If you
find yourself stuck on something, contact the course staff for help.
Office hours, section, and the discussion forum are there for your
support; please use them. If you can't make our office hours, let us
know and we will schedule more. We want these projects to be rewarding
and instructional, not frustrating and demoralizing. But, we don't know
when or how to help unless you ask.</p>

          <h2><a id="Warehouse"></a>The Warehouse Environment</h2>
          <p>The warehouse layout is given as a 4-connected grid.
            One or more robots operate inside the warehouse. Each robot has
            10 different actions that it can perform. Only one action can be
            performed per time step. Each of the available action takes exactly
            one time step to perform. Some actions might be inadmissible at
            some states. The set of available actions are:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>  <code>turn_north</code> = change the robot’s heading to face North
            </li><li>	<code>turn_east</code> = change the robot’s heading to face East
            </li><li>	<code>turn_south</code> = change the robot’s heading to face South
            </li><li>	<code>turn_west</code> = change the robot’s heading to face West
            </li><li>	<code>accelerate</code> = increase the speed of the robot by 1 (cell/time step). The speed limit is currently set to 1.
            </li><li>	<code>decelerate</code> = reduce the speed of the robot by 1 (cell/time step). The speed cannot be lower than 0.
            </li><li>	<code>lift</code> = pick up a package. Only applicable if the robot is in the same location as the package and has a velocity of 0.
            </li><li>	<code>drop</code> = drop a package. Only applicable if the robot is carrying a package and has a velocity of 0.
            </li><li>	<code>no_op</code> = do nothing (the robot will still advance if its velocity is not 0).
            </li><li>	<code>process</code> = process a mounted package at a processing station.
            </li></ol>
            Whenever a robot is assigned a new destination. You must help it
            plan a sequence of actions that will get it to its destination with
            velocity of 0. The plan should require the minimal number of time
            steps i.e., optimal plan.

          <h2><a id="Start"></a>Getting Started</h2>
          <p>Run: </p><pre>python main.py</pre> Notice a single robot is delivering
            random pods to random packing stations. For each of the robot’s
            tasks (go to pod, go to station, put pod back) the robot computes
            and executes the shortest path by running uniform cost search.
You can notice that each planning episode stops the program for a fraction of a
second (watch the time step counter on the upper right corner).
Open <code>main.py</code>, change the scenario from <code>Warehouse-1.map</code> to <code>arena2-1.map</code>.
This is a much bigger map and UCS is very slow to plan. <p></p>

          <h2><a id="Q1"></a>Question 1: Single Agent Heuristic</h2>
          <p>Your first task is to utilize the A* algorithm by setting an
            admissible heuristic value in the single-agent state. You should be
            able to run <code>arena2-1.map</code> reasonably fast (&lt;5 second

            <p>Open <code>Planning/SingleAgentState.py</code>, add an admissible
              heuristic for the single-agent case (see <code># TODO: Your job -
                Set a better heuristic value.</code>).</p>
                <p>Tip: you can use <code>self.robot.position_x</code> for the
                  robot’s <i>x</i> coordinate and <code>self.robot.goal_x</code> for
                  the goal’s <i>x</i> coordinate. Same goes for the <i>y</i> coordinates.</p>

          <p>Open <code>main.py</code>, change the scenario field from <code>arena2-1.map</code> to
            <code>Toy-MAPF-2.map</code>. This is a multiagent pathfinding problem with 2
            agents. This instance is solved with UCS on the combined
            state-space. UCS can easily overcome this simple problem. Now,
            change <code>Toy-MAPF-2.map</code> to <code>Warehouse-MAPF-2.map</code> UCS for

            <p>Your third task is to implement the CBS algorithm. This is an
