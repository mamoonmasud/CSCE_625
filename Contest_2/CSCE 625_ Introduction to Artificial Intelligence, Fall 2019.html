            <h2><a id="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
            <p>In this contest, you will implement an agent for playing the
              repeated prisoner dilemma game. This game has a twist in the form
              of uncertainty regarding the reported opponent action from the
              previous round. The contest code is available as a zip
              archive (<code><a href="https://people.engr.tamu.edu/guni/csce625/contest2.zip">contest2.zip</a></code>).</p>

            <p>
There is room to bring your own unique ideas, and there is no single set
 solution. Much looking forward to seeing what you come up with!</p>

              separated by ‘:’ (not by ‘,’) in the “UIN” field, choose a team
              name at “your team name”, Write your strategy under the “play”
              function. Your strategy should take into account the opponent’s
              previous action and level of uncertainty regarding the previous
              action report.</li>
            <li>Run <code>python Game.py</code>, for each pair of players in the
               Players folder, 1000 rounds will be played on expectation (there
               is a 0.001e^(-0.001) chance of terminating on every round). </li>

          <h2><a id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
          <p>You are required to design an agent that plays the prisoner dilemma
             repeatedly against the same opponent. Your agent should attempt to
             maximize its utility where. As we saw in class, the Nash
             equilibrium for this game results in low utility for both players.
             You should attempt to coordinate a better outcome over repeated
             rounds.</p>

 If you copy someone else's code and submit it with minor changes,
            we will know. These cheat detectors are quite hard to fool,
so please don't try. We trust you all to submit your own work only; <em>please</em> don't let us down.

            Office hours, section, and the discussion forum are there
for your support; please use them. If you can't make our office hours,
let us know and we will schedule more.
            We want these contests to be rewarding and instructional,
not frustrating and demoralizing. But, we don't know when or how to help
 unless you ask.</p>

          <p>Once you run Game.py, a tournament will take place during which
            every pair of players, defined in the Players directory, will face
            each other. Each match will consist of 1000 rounds in expectancy.</p>

          <h3 id="Scoring">Scoring</h3>
          <p>For each round in a single match you will receive -1 (i.e., 1 year
            in jail) points if  you confess while your opponent is silent, -4
            if you both confess, -5 if you are silent while your opponent
            confesses, and -2 if you both keep silent.
Your average score from a single match will be summed over all matches to
determine your overall ranking. Your final score will be determined based on
your overall rank. Based to the grading policy provided above.</p>

          <h3>File Format</h3>
          <p>You should include your agents in a file of the same format as <code>MyPlayer.py</code>. Your agents must be completely contained in this one file.</p>

          <h3>Agent</h3>
          <p>Your agent should attempt to exploit naïve opponents, not being
            exploited by aggressive opponent, and encourage opponent cooperation
             when appropriate. The best strategy depends on the strategy
             implemented by your opponent. Try to design an agent that can adapt
              to different opponents. Remember that your goal is not to win
              single matches but to gain the maximal score over all matches.
              That is, even if you are able to outperform the staff bots in a
              single match, you might still get an overall score that is lower
              because the overall scores are summed over all matches.</p>

            “confess”. Now run <code>Game.py</code>. A tournament will run matching your
            player with all three staff bots. The tournament outcome (final
            scores) will be written to <code>results.csv</code>. You should now attempt to
            improve your agent’s strategy to the best of your understanding.
