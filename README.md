These files are for the course CSCE 625, taught at Texas A&M University by Prof. Guni Sharon in Fall 2020. Some of the projects are from the course   <a href="http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html" target="_new">CS-188, Intro to AI.</a> <br/>
The html files contain all the details about each project. Almost all the projects have an autograder, so you can code and verify your solutions.<br/>
The contests don't have an auto-grader, since for them, we were graded against each-other's solutions in the class.
